                    called Pikachu's Beach. This can only be activated in the original editions of the games
                     by transferring a surfing Pikachu from other games. In the Virtual Console editions, 
                     only the starter Pikachu is needed. The Surfin' Dude there apparently also has a 
                     surfing Pikachu.</p><br><p>Players can obtain a Surfing Pikachu on Pokémon Ultra
                      Sun and Ultra Moon by beating the high score of "Big Boss" in Mantine Surfing.</p>

                    movie, and by extension, the anime's 20th anniversary. Like Ash's Pikachu, these Pikachu 
                    are always male and cannot evolve. They also have access to the exclusive Z-Crystal, 
                    Pikashunium Z, and its Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt.</p><br><p>
                    A seventh Cap Pikachu, wearing the hat Ash wears in the twentieth movie, 
                    will debut in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. In Japan, it will be 
                    distributed via QR Code on a special Pokémon Ga-Olé disc. In America, it will 
                    be distributed via a QR Code that will be given to those who pre-order tickets
                    for the 20th movie.
